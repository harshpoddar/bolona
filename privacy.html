            content revealing your race, religion, or sexual orientation).
            Sensitive personal information is not required or necessary to use
            the Services – please do not include any sensitive personal

          </p>

          <h3>Information we collect about your use of the Services</h3>
          <p>
            We and our third-party providers, which include advertising and
            analytics providers and other service providers, use cookies, web
            beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about
            your use of the Services. Please note that the specific tracking
            technologies and third-party providers may vary depending on where
            you are located and whether you access the Services via our websites
            or mobile applications. For more information about these
            technologies, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As described further in the Cookie Policy, we use these technologies
            to collect and analyze device, Internet, and other electronic network
            activity information including information about your computer or
            device (e.g., device type; browser type; ISP or operating system; IP
            address; device identifiers such as IDFA, Android ID, etc.; version
            of our Services you are using); information about how you use and
            interact with the Services (e.g., domain name; access time; referring
            or exit pages; page views; Service-related identifiers such as User
            ID, Chat ID, Session ID, etc.; and actions taken within the
            Services); and geolocation data.
          </p>

          <h3>Information we collect from other sources</h3>
          <p>
            We may also collect information from other sources, such as when you
            are referred to us by another user. In this context, we may receive
            your name and contact details. We may also receive information from
            third-party platforms, for example, such as when you interact with
            our ads on other platforms like YouTube, TikTok, or Reddit, or when
            you interact with our social media profiles on platforms like
            Facebook, Instagram, or Discord. Information we collect in this
            context includes information about how you interacted with our ads or
            the third-party platform; information about your device; demographic
            information (e.g., age, interests); and geolocation data.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also collect information when you connect to your account using an
            account maintained by a third party, such as a social media account
            (“Third-Party Account”). The Services collect information about you
            from your Third-Party Accounts in accordance with your permissions.
            When you connect to us or log in through a Third-Party Account like
            Facebook or Google, we receive information from that third party
            identifying your account. Information we collect in this context
            includes third-party account details such as username or email
            address. We collect and store this information and use it to help
            you connect to the Services. Connecting your account to a Third-Party
            Account is completely optional, and you will have the opportunity to
            grant permission when you attempt to connect. You can revoke
            permission by logging into the Third-Party Account and disconnecting
            Bolo na from there, and through the native applications on your mobile
            device. Please note that if you revoke permission for a Third-Party
            Account, we may retain the information we collected previously from
            the Third-Party Account provider (but the accounts will not be linked
            going forward).

            other publicly available sources to evaluate and improve our

            the extent we anonymize any data originally based on personal

If you do not provide us with such information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services. The information we collect includes data you directly provide to us, data we obtain automatically from your interactions with our Services, and data we obtain from other sources.

Please note that the specific tracking technologies and third-party providers may vary depending on where you are located and whether you access the Services via our websites or mobile applications. For more information about these technologies, please refer to our Cookie Policy.

As described further in the Cookie Policy, we use these technologies to collect and analyze device, Internet, and other electronic network activity information including information about your computer or device (e.g., device type; browser type; ISP or operating system; IP address; device identifiers such as IDFA, Android ID, etc.; version of our Services you are using); information about how you use and interact with the Services (e.g., domain name; access time; referring or exit pages; page views; Service-related identifiers such as User ID, Chat ID, Session ID, etc.; and actions taken within the Services); and geolocation data.

Information we collect from other sources. We may also collect information from other sources, such as when you are referred to us by another user. In this context, we may receive your name and contact details.
